## Tools and Frameworks

### Frontend Design Frameworks
1. **Tailwind CSS**: Highly customizable with a utility-first approach, perfect for creating a bespoke, futuristic design. Recommended if you want more design freedom and to keep the site lightweight.
2. **Material UI**: Provides pre-designed components with a clean, modern look, aligned with Google's Material Design guidelines. Good for a polished, professional appearance with less customization.
3. **Bootstrap**: Great for fast development and a responsive grid system, but may not offer the level of uniqueness you’re aiming for. You can still customize it to fit a more modern style.

**Recommendation**: Use **Tailwind CSS** for the flexibility to create a more futuristic, customized design while maintaining a minimalistic approach. Combine it with **Figma** or **Adobe XD** for designing mockups and UI flows.
